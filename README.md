# Flight-Price-Prediction

# Problem Statement
Flight ticket prices can be something hard to guess, To solve this problem, we have been provided with prices of flight tickets for various airlines between the months of March and June of 2019 and between various cities, using which we aim to build a model which predicts the prices of the flights using various input features.
